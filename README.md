# Parser Workbench 2

Written by Alex Curtis in 2009

A program written in Perl for experimenting with parsing natural language. Includes an implementation of an Earley Parser!

The program has a CLI that accepts either English sentences, or control commands. Control commands are prefixed with an asterisk.


To run:

    perl pbench2.pl
    *HELP

Have a look at `test.txt` for usage examples.
